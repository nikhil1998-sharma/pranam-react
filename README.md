## JSX

- JSX is not "HTML inside JavaScript"
- You can call it "HTML like Syntax"
- JSX is not part of React, they both are different
- JS Engine will not understand JSX, parcel is working behind the scene
- JSX (transpiled before it reaches to the JS Engine) - Parcel - Babel
- Babel is transpiling the code - it takes JS code and convert into the code that JS Engine can understand
- JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTMLElement(render)
